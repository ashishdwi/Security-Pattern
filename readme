Analyzing system requirements using formal modeling
language Alloy has a number of advantages. Firstly, it
provides an executable notation, that ensures about the
functionality of Alloy model, having an unambiguous
and consistent semantics. Secondly, the Alloy Analyzer
translates high-level, declarative, relational expressions
of the Alloy notation into a SAT (Satisfiability) formula.
These SAT expressions can be executed by using
a number of SAT solvers such as, SAT4J, Zchaff,
MiniSAT etc. Thirdly, it can visualize an Alloy notation
of unbounded size and subsequently specifies it to
a bounded size. In order to make the pattern notations
more precise, Alloy is chosen as a correct methodology
for analyzing essential requirements of security design
patterns. Behavioral properties of these patterns can be
represented in the form of predicate logic, which can be
verified by using Alloy Analyzer tool.
